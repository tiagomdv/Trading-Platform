//////// TRADING PLATFORM \\\\\\\
created by Tiago Vieira

Summary:
This web application simulates a trading platform. 
In this application one can buy and sell shares and other assets like commodities, bonds, crypto assets, etc, and use margin/leverage to acquire them.
One can visualize these assets information in the market page to better sense what asset is acquiring.

One can control the asset portfolio through a built in dashboard where one can check the portfolio summary, returns and how well diversified it is.

Also, one is able to control personal expenses with a built in dashboard to better control where the money is being spent.

Tips:
- In the main page there is some information on how to use the web application.
- After register, go to profile tab in account section and set a initial cash value.
- In market page, the load time can be up to 50 seconds in some areas. If one knows stock ticker symbols, just insert them in the input field to check the related information and 
then process order.
- In the buying window, buy order is the default. If selling is the choice, just click sell button.

The remaining functionality is pretty intuitive.

Have fun! 

CS50X is the best!
